# Android Dev Challenge #3 AKA WeTrade

## :scroll: Description
Third challenge of the Android Compose dev challenges. Doing this in my free time after work and around family time.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
My motivation is to become even more familiar with Compose and have fun creating UIs.

I came back in and added screenshots and finished this up as much as I wanted to. I got most things done, and stopped when I felt I got the benefit from it.

This was one of the better compose challenges because it showcases a lot of different items from compose. I did the challenge after the challenge window because I wanted to learn, but didn't want to rush and finish this.
